abstract="Digital 3D models have emerged as a new type of multimedia following sound, image and video. This media type has been distributed and processed widely on desktop PCs. However, processing 3D models on mobile devices is more difficult, mainly due to their physical constraints. Though the remote rendering framework is able to make up for some deficiencies, previous methods based on this framework suffered from high transmission frequency, which just imposes a high power demand on mobile devices' already limited battery life. In this paper, a new transmission control method, Adaptive Splitting and Error Handling Mechanism, is proposed to be integrated with canonical remote rendering system. Our mechanism is able to reduce transmission frequency by trading transmission with splitting operations. According to relevant research findings, reducing frequency will result in a decline in power consumption. Finally, the effectiveness of our method in terms of frequency reduction is validated by comparison with state of the art method.",

pages="1983--2004",
abstract="Large 3D meshes are emerging as the new media for various applications but are still hard to use in mobile applications, due to the limited resources of mobile systems. This paper introduces a large 3D mesh streaming framework which flexibly deals with the limited resources of mobile systems and also provides a user with interactive controls and random accessibilities. To reduce resource usage, our framework presents a uniform mesh partitioning algorithm, in which each partition of a large mesh has the same number of vertices. Our uniform partitioning is based on a k-d tree clustering and extended for out-of-core meshes. A median search with heaps in the main memory is designed for faster external sorting. Large 3D meshes are transformed into a set of partitioned and simplified meshes in the server. For interactive 3D browsing, on mobile devices, our framework presents a mobile 3D viewer which is hierarchically designed with intuitive interfaces. A user can experience rapid 3D searches with 3D previews of simplified meshes. Multi touch inputs can control zooming and the level of detail in meshes automatically. Double tap touches enable a user to randomly select a region of a large mesh, and a set of partitions for the selected region will be streamed and displayed on a mobile client. As a result, our framework enables a user to browse large 3D meshes on a mobile system interactively, while optimizing system resource usage and protecting the original data in the server.",

abstract="Remote rendering is a well-known solution to the issue of running high-performance applications requiring complex visualizations on less capable hardware/software platforms or when client access to the data source for visualization is undesired or prohibitive in terms of required bandwidth. Visualizing the output of these remote rendering applications is typically achieved through native applications or, when considering a browser environment, through plug-ins. In this paper, several solutions are presented that enable deployment of these applications on standard web browsers, even those from the pre-HTML5 era. The focus in this paper is on two specific use case scenarios, taking into account that the proposed solutions are generic enough to be applied to a range of similar applications. The technologies presented cover the entire range of sub-processes contained in a complete remote rendering solution, such as the establishment of interaction feedback channels and delivery of images as part of the rendering pipeline. Depending on factors such as application requirements, developer preferences, feature availability in the web browser or raw performance figures, a custom solution can be composed from the options discussed in this paper. This is illustrated by applying them to the two aforementioned use cases, each with specific requirements and challenges, and benchmarking these example setups in terms of performance. A comparison of advantages and disadvantages is presented to guide developers in applying the technologies under real-life conditions.",

abstract="Nowadays, mobile devices are becoming the most popular computing device as their computing capabilities increase rapidly. However, it is still challenging to execute highly sophisticated applications such as 3D video games on mobile devices due to its constrained key computational resources. Execution offloading approaches have been proposed to resolve this problem by strengthening mobile devices with powerful cloud. Unfortunately, the existing offloading approaches are not suitable for 3D video games because of the unique execution characteristics of them. In this paper, we propose a streaming-based execution offloading framework to enable execution offloading for 3D video games. The experiments show that our framework successfully guarantees 20 frames per second for our benchmark.",

volume="61",
number="2",
pages="447--470",
abstract="According to the thin client computing principle, the user interface is physically separated from the application logic. In practice only a viewer component is executed on the client device, rendering the display updates received from the distant application server and capturing the user interaction. Existing remote display frameworks are not optimized to encode the complex scenes of modern applications, which are composed of objects with very diverse graphical characteristics. In order to tackle this challenge, we propose to transfer to the client, in addition to the binary encoded objects, semantic information about the characteristics of each object. Through this semantic knowledge, the client is enabled to react autonomously on user input and does not have to wait for the display update from the server. Resulting in a reduction of the interaction latency and a mitigation of the bursty remote display traffic pattern, the presented framework is of particular interest in a wireless context, where the bandwidth is limited and expensive. In this paper, we describe a generic architecture of a semantic remote display framework. Furthermore, we have developed a prototype using the MPEG-4 Binary Format for Scenes to convey the semantic information to the client. We experimentally compare the bandwidth consumption of MPEG-4 BiFS with existing, non-semantic, remote display frameworks. In a text editing scenario, we realize an average reduction of 23{\%} of the data peaks that are observed in remote display protocol traffic.",

In those, a minimal capture-display delay is critical. Though recent technological advances have certainly made it possible to provide web-based interactive live-streaming, little research is available that compares the real-world performance of the different web-based schemes. In this paper we use educational remote laboratories as a case study. We analyze the restrictions that web-based interactive live-streaming applications have, such as a low delay. We also consider additional characteristics that are often sought in production systems, such as universality and deployability behind institutional firewalls. The paper describes and experimentally compares the most relevant approaches for the study. With the provided descriptions and real-world experimental results, researchers, designers and developers can: a) select among the interactive live-streaming approaches which are available for their real-world systems, b) decide which one is most appropriate for their purpose, and c) know what performance and results they can expect.",

Due to the limitation of computation, memory, display area and energy, how to realize the efficient and real-time interaction of 3D models based on mobile devices is an important research topic. Considering features of mobile devices, this paper adopts remote rendering mode and point models, and then, proposes a transmission and rendering approach that could interact in real time. First, improved simplification algorithm based on MLS and display resolution of mobile devices is proposed. Then, a hierarchy selection of point models and a QoS transmission control strategy are given based on interest area of operator, interest degree of object in the virtual environment and rendering error. They can save the energy consumption. Finally, the rendering and interaction of point models are completed on mobile devices. The experiments show that our method is efficient.",

abstract="Cloud Mobile 3D Display Gaming has been recently proposed where 3D video rendering and encoding are performed on cloud servers, with the resulting 3D video streamed wirelessly to mobile devices with 3D displays. This approach has the advantage of relieving high computation, power and storage requirements of 3D display gaming from mobile devices, while enabling game developers to focus on a single rich version of the game which can be experienced from any mobile device and platform. However, it is challenging to stream 3D video over dynamically fluctuating and often constrained mobile networks. In this paper, we propose a novel technique called Asymmetric and Selective Object Rendering (ASOR) which proves to be more powerful than previous solutions for Cloud based Mobile 3D display gaming. Specifically, this technique will enable rendering engine to intelligently decide whether or not to render an individual object and how good the corresponding texture detail will be if rendered, and the settings can be asymmetric for two views. Thus, unimportant objects can trade quality for reduced bitrate while important objects can remain high quality so that the overall user experience is optimized given certain bandwidth constraints. To quantitatively measure the user experience and bitrate by applying different rendering settings, we develop a user experience model and a bitrate model. We further propose an optimization algorithm which uses the above two models to automatically decide the optimal rendering settings for left view and right view to ensure the best user experience given the network conditions. Experiments conducted using real 4G-LTE network profiles on commercial cloud service with different genres of games demonstrate significant improvement in user experience when the proposed optimization algorithm is applied.",
