For sensory motor skills, repeated practice (often under supervision and guidance of an expert mentor) is required in order to progressively understand the consequences of our actions, adapt our behavior and develop optimal perception-action loops needed to intuitively and efficiently perform the task. VR multimodal platforms, if adequately designed, can offer an alternative to real environments therefore. Indeed they present interesting features: controlled environment, measure of the user's performance, display of quantitative feedback. This paper presents such a platform that was developed for surgery skills training.",

AR content created by the user is stored in a separate txt file for easy sharing, modification, and reusability. A user testing of the published examination application was also conducted, and participants in the testing offered generally positive feedback.",

abstract="We present a virtual reality system targeted at building a calligraphy training environment. Our main goal is to construct a virtual space enabling learners to intuitively acquire hard-to-inherit skills through the development of a Japanese calligraphy training system. The proposed system provides a haptic interaction channel allowing the learners to intuitively master instructor's fine motor skills through the sense of touch. We utilize a commercially available haptic device called PHANTOM for simulating a writing brush in a virtual training space. The system implements a function for recording and replaying instructor's hand motions via the PHANTOM device. The instructor's writing techniques such as brush-strokes and pen pressures are recorded when he/she is writing characters and they are effectively reproduced and presented to the learners via the PHANTOM device. The learners can master how to write the recorded characters by feeling the instructor's style of handwritings. We implemented a simple yet powerful 3D brush model for real-time visualization of handwritten characters without compromising the quality and reality of the visualized characters. The learners can start training at any time and iterate training sessions without worrying about resource consumptions such as papers and ink as much as they like. We conducted two experiments to validate the effectiveness of the proposed system for learning calligraphy in a virtual environment.",

These methods include classroom lectures with textbooks, computers, handheld devices, and other electronic appliances. The choice of learning innovation is dependent on an individual's access to various technologies and the infrastructure environment of a person's surrounding. In a rapidly changing society where there is a great deal of available information and knowledge, adopting and applying information at the right time and right place is needed to main efficiency in both school and business settings. Augmented Reality (AR) is one technology that dramatically shifts the location and timing of education and training.

Our approach combines AR graphics with adaptive guidance from the ITS to provide a more effective learning experience. We have developed a modular software framework for intelligent AR training systems, and a prototype based on this framework that teaches novice users how to assemble a computer motherboard. An evaluation found that our intelligent AR system improved test scores by 25{\%} and that task performance was 30{\%} faster compared to the same AR training system without intelligent support. We conclude that using intelligent AR tutor can significantly improve learning compared to traditional AR training.",
